Freedom Tree
free help with civil rights now!

Identifying civil rights violations and addressing grievances is the core mission of Freedom Tree, a new nonprofit organization. 

Freedom Tree is also a free web app designed to help users quickly determine if their civil rights are being violated. When violations are confirmed, Freedom Tree provides clients with educational information, direct communications and assistance, and, when necessary, facilitates referrals to the advocacy organizations, agencies, or legal counsel for help.

Freedom Tree also hosts Civil Rights Wiki, a website that brings together organizations, agencies, and legal counsel to provide services to clients and collaborate on matters relating to the civil rights in the United States.
